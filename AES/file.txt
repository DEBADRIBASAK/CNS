We would like to thank the Google Brain team for providing an intellectual
environment where Ian could devote a tremendous amount of time to writing this
book and receive feedback and guidance from colleagues. We would especially like
to thank Ian's former manager, Greg Corrado, and his current manager, Samy
Bengio, for their support of this project. Finally, we would like to thank Geoffrey
Hinton for encouragement when writing was difficult.
